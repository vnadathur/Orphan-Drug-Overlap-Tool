# Overlap Reports

Select a threshold-specific page from the sidebar to browse CDSCO ↔︎ FDA drug name pairs captured at that similarity cutoff. Each page includes:

- A clearly labeled download link to the raw CSV (with every column).
- An embedded two-column view (CDSCO drug ↔︎ FDA drug) rendered directly from the CSV via `mkdocs-table-reader-plugin`.

Start with 85% (the default pipeline setting), then explore the tighter or more permissive thresholds as needed for your analysis.
